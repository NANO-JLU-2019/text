<strong>We use a coarse-grained model to represent (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> and LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP, as illustrated schematically in Fig.1, according to the estimated ratio of diameter of two building blocks. The length of the ELP part is about 15 while the length of the leucine zipper is about 14 and the length of the functional area is about 5. In Fig.1, each segment of C arms and P arms were given 7 positive charges and 7 negative charges respectively. </strong>

<p><font size="+2">▶Result & Discussion:</font></p>
<strong>At first, we need to ensure our model can exhibit the same conformation with experiment. Since our experiment of assembly may be done by two steps, our self-assembly simulation is also conducted by two separate steps in order to reproduce the actual situation. Totally, simulation have three parts.</strong>
<p>Study conformation of building blocks in dilute solution.</p>
<strong>Before studying the properties of self-assembly, we first simulate the conformation of LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP and (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub>. The bond angle was set to 180° for C type and P type to give segment of leucine zipper rigidity, meanwhile we set lower k (k=100) value and larger r<sub>m</sub>(r<sub>m</sub>=1.5) value for FENE bond potential to increase the flexibility of connection between different types of beads (Fig.2). The segment of leucine zipper has a stronger rigidity thus they can maintain a certain configuration in solution while the segment of ELP is very flexible and exhibits a configuration of random coil in dilute solution. This result shows good anastomosis with CD spectrum and secondary structure prediction of the sequence design, consequently, increasing our simulation credibility.

      </figure>
      Verify the dimerization between shell chain segment and core domain unit.
     <p> <strong>The (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> and LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP were connected by dimerization of leucine zippers, which is mainly achieved by hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction at certain sites. Our leucine zippers have α-helix structure with some charged residues and hydrophobic residues on different directions at one same side of the helix, besides, the leucine zippers of LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP and (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> have different charges so assembly specificity can be obtained. But in the coarse-grained simulation, we can see the model only have one kind of bead in one side of the chain, so this kind of specificity of dimerization is hard to be accurately reproduced by our model because we can’t make beads anisotropic to let one bead exhibit different properties at different directions. Therefore, we simplified the interaction of leucine zippers and explored whether dimerization of LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP and (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> can be observed in simulation by studying this simplified electrostatic interaction and hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction from a pair of building blocks.</strong></p>
     <p><strong>The C and P segment were given 7 positive charges and 7 negative charges respectively to set up coulomb interaction. The rcut values of Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential for S-C, S-P, S-Z, C-Z, Z-P were set to 1.12 in order to reproduce the effects of hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction. The simulation result is shown in Fig.3</strong></p><figure>

      <p class="description">Figure3. Dimerization between (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> and LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP.</p>
      </figure>
<strong> We want to achieve the direction-specific dimerization of the LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP and (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub>, namely, to ensure that the ELP and (EK)<sub>10</sub> segment stay at different ends of dimer rather than at the same side. ELP segment shows to be hydrophobic while (EK)<sub>10</sub> is hydrophilic at 37°C and areas with same kind of water affinity tends to be gathered at the same area. So we used this property of ELPs at 37°C to compensate for the loss of directional specificity caused by coarse granulation, and correct dimer can be observed.</strong>
<p>Simulate the formation of ERPC.</p>

      <p class="description">Figure4. Assembly of LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP.</p>
      </figure>
    <strong> In our design, assembly region and functional region are separate to (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> and LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP. And TEM result indicate that LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP can be assembled by itself. Thus, the simulation of ERPCs’ assembly is conducted by assembly of LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP itself and assembly between (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> and LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP.
<p>Therefore, we set the α value of Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential for S-S to 2.0, while the α value for C-C is set to 0.5. 80 chains are randomly generated in a box of 35x35x35. Result was shown in Fig.4, which reveals that micelle with relatively uniform particle size is formed, and it is consistent with the results of experiment part.</p> 
<p>For assembly between L(EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> and LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP, since the dimerization of leucine zipper is regulated mainly by hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction while hydrogen bonding also plays a supporting role, the interaction between leucine zipper can be strong and complex. To make it feasible to simulate LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP as the core domain and (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> as the "shell" with our coarse-grained model, we connect the (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> and LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP covalently to simulate the assembly of ERPCs, based on the simulation result of Fig. 3, which indicated that the dimerization of the leucine zipper can be achieved and the fact that hydrogen bond cannot be accurately reproduced in our coarse-grained Brownian dynamic simulation. </p>
<p>C segment and P segment are connected through 6 FENE bonds, 40 building blocks are randomly generated in the box under the same conditions (Fig.5). The result demonstrates that the building block forms a spherical micelle with (EK)<sub>10</sub> at the outermost, ELPs in inner part.</p></strong>

    <h3><p><font size="+2">▶Steered molecular Dynamics Simulation on the interactions between LZ<sub>R</sub>-LZ<sub>E</sub></font></p></h3>
<h3><strong> In order to further examine the stability of out assembly, we want to know how strong the interactions to connect our building blocks, namely, the interactions between LZ<sub>R</sub> and LZ<sub>E</sub> are. However, due to the limit of computing resources, we are unable to build a system big enough at nanometers level. Rather, we build the system of a single LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP and a single (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub>. Then we use SMD to stretch one chain, while fixing the other, at a constant rate to break the interactions and record the steered force used.</strong></h3>
   <h3> <p><font size="+2">▶Model and Method</font></p></h3>
<h3><strong>The original structure of LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP and (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> is gained as stated in Sequence Design. Construction of the system is performed using visual molecular dynamics (VMD) <sup>[1]</sup>. We generate water using Solvate Plugin. Then we add Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> to the system using autoionize Plugin, making the concentration of ions 0.15 M and the whole system is electrically neutral. Now the system is of 152485 atoms with 49350 water molecule, 291 Na<sup>+</sup> and 298 Cl<sup>-</sup>(Fig. 1).</strong></h3>

2. We relax the protein as well and run it 20 ns while using a secondary structure restrain to the LZ<sub>R</sub> and LZ<sub>E</sub> and forcing them maintain the secondary structure of helix (Fig. 2).</strong></h3>

 <h3>  <p><font size="+2">▶MD protocol</font></p></h3>
<h3><strong>All MD simulations are run in NAMD using the CHARMM36m force field for proteins<sup>[3]</sup>. Constant temperature (310 K) and pressure (1 atm) were maintained. A time step of 2 fs was used with short-range nonbonded interactions updated every time step and long-range nonbonded interactions updated every three timesteps. The cutoff for short-range nonbonded interactions is 12.0 Å. The Parti-cle Mesh Ewald (PME) method is used for long-range nonbonded interactions.</strong></h3>

<strong>We do Steered Molecular Dynamics to stretch (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> away from LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP. Here is the result of our SMD simulation (Fig. 3). </strong>

    <h3>
<strong>We record the distance of (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> and LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP by measuring the distance between center of mass of LZ<sub>R</sub> and LZ<sub>E</sub> (Fig. 4). Stretched by the additional force, the distance is increasing along the simulation as we expected. Then we record the force (Fig. 5) and run average of force vs. time with averages taken over 0.5 ns. We can conclude that the force reaches its maximum of 1074.8 pN at 8.97 ns. The force applied here is extremely huge regarding nonbonded interactions while 600 pN is enough to stretch a NH3 molecule out of a channel! </strong>

<strong>In conclusion, the interactions between LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP and (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> are extremely strong <sup>[4]</sup>, and even a single set requires 1074.8 pN to break them up. Considering how many sets we are going to have in an assembly, we can conclude that it is almost impossible to break once they are formed. This strongly suggests that our carrier could be extraordinarily stable, which guarantees the safety of drugs as well as the successful delivery.</strong></h3>
