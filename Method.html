 <h3>   <strong> In order to prevent his-tag on LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP  from interfering with self-assembly of LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP, we provided DNA sequences coding LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP  and PAP respectively to BGI to get co-expression plasmid so that we could purify LZ<sub>R</sub>-ELP  through high affinity interaction between LZ<sub>R</sub> and LZ<sub>E</sub>.
<p>We also designed DNA sequence coding (EK)<sub>10</sub>-TAT-LZ<sub>E</sub> and provided it to GENWIZ to get recombination plasmid. </p></strong></h3>
